# FINTESS MANAGER
A customer managment app for personal trainers.

## Description
This app was created as part of a college project for Mobile App Development 2. This app allows a personal trainer to create their customers and view them on a "My Customers" view. It will also allow you to look at all the customers in a gym (even those created by other personal trainers) and it will allow you to see which custoemrs are premium members.

It uses Firebase to store the data in real-time and allows you to sign in with email or directly from your google account.
  
This app was developed using Kotlin and android studio by me , using help from in-class labs and 
various tutorials, please view full reference list below
